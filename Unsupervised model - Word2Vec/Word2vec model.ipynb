I was expecting full racks, shelves and trays stacked with goodies and glass display cabinets filled with cakes of all sorts. What I saw, instead, were half empty racks, table of cookies had few selections and atmosphere did not have the great aroma of a fresh bakery. And to top it off, my cashier very young lady was not that friendly. Did not even make eye contact as she accepted my payment.  Like I said, maybe just an off day! \\nSo I return another day. And, this time it was in the afternoon. Did not see another customer so I figured quick service. Well, three employees were there talking fairly loud. One acknowledged my presence and gave me a greeting. She had to get through two other employees deep in their loud conversation. The lady taking my order had to asked me twice what I said.  She would apologize for not hearing me the first time as she also apologized for the loud noise coming from the other two.  I got my order and went on my way. \\nThe donuts are ok.

(I love the mochi, pocky, and condensed milk). If you haven't had rolled ice cream before, the texture is a lot more dense and solid than normal ice cream. It's definitely a shareable portion.

      "[\"This place is fantastic. I was apprehensive (as I often am walking into bike shops) when I walked in, but quickly realized that this place was different. There were some hard core road bikers in the back talking in their own language, a few weekend warriors getting their bikes worked on and getting gear, and me: an aspiring cyclist intimidated by the prices, lingo, and other details of taking up this pastime.  I normally cringe when I walk into bike stores and feel that if I don't drop 4 grand quickly on a carbon fiber bike or show them the yellow jersey I wore when leading three stages of the Tour de France, that I'll quickly be shown the exit (or a brusque cold shoulder).\\n\\nAt this place, a guy came up and asked what I was looking for and how he could help. I explained my situation: I have a road bike, I want to start using it as my primary means of transportation and for recreation, and I want to get the rest of the equipment that I need. He quickly explained what equipment is NEEDED versus what equipment is NICE TO HAVE. We went through helmets, floor pumps, bike shorts, bike shoes, flat kits, etc. I already have shoes and pedals as well as some tire repair kits. When I told him that, he quickly moved on - never pressuring me to upgrade or to change anything. We talked tire options (tube liners/extra-thick tires/tube sealant), tune up needs, maintenance suggestions, etc.\\n\\nIn the end, I only bought a helmet because I had all of the gear in the NEED category already. As I get going, I'll add the NICE TO HAVE stuff as I see fit. And I'll buy it from Reno Cycling & Fitness because they know how to treat customers. So it is amazing, for a fairly minor purchase, this guy invested nearly half an hour talking to me - never talking down to me. He understood my needs, listened when i talked and helped me immensely.\\n\\nIn a world of diminishing customer service, this place stands out. The depth of knowledge available will not be found in a big box store or at an online discounter. Keep honest, hardworking local companies in business and help yourself in the process.\"\n",

Best seats in the house!\\n\\nThey were super efficient in making the pizzas. All the ingredients looked fresh and plentiful on the pizzas themselves.

Looking at that, as well as the menu, I didn't want anything small anymore but wanted to try a little bit of everything.\\n\\nGot the Italian Cesar salad- anchovies topped the salad so it had that saltiness in each and every bite.

I love the crust of these pizzas- perfectly charred from the oven. The pepperoni was crunchy and not oily. It was like eating tiny pepperoni chips! For the crudo pie, The prosciutto was great with the buffalo mozzarella and every bite was salty and creamy. \\n\\nEven though we were full, we wanted to try the nutella pie for dessert. So glad I did! The pie was again perfectly charred and the nutella and marshmallow was perfectly melted. I just wish I had milk to wash it all down.\\n\\nOverall a great experience.

      "[\"I actually didn't know that this restaurant was a chain, but it's a good thing because there are more locations of this good restaurant. \\n\\nI've tried multiple dishes from here including their home style tofu, vegetable soup, lamb dishes, and their sliced tofu with grounded pork. They're definitely a traditional Chinese restaurant in terms of food, but the atmosphere is westernized. Their food is definitely spicy, something I'm not necessarily good with. Luckily, they allow you to customize the spicy levels. \\n\\nThe service is fast and attentive, but there are little to no Chinese Waiters. Thus, if you're a traditional Chinese, plan on ordering in English (I don't quite remember if there's even Chinese on the menu). \\n\\nOverall, a good restaurant. It has a nice location close to both UPenn and Drexel, and the price is average to a little pricey. Good food, good location, good stuff.\"\n",

      " \"I came to DiVino wine bar, just south of Rittenhouse square on 19th street, with my kickball team after a game.  We had a large party, more than 10 of us, and the restaurant was very accomodating.  We sat in the back and enjoyed the mellow ambience.  The owner was very kind and came over to explain some additions to the menu as well as his vision for the restaurant.  Apparently, as has been noted in other reviews, DiVino will soon be changing to Cichetteria 19, focused on traditional Italian small plates.\\n\\nNow to the nitty gritty:  My girlfriend and I shared one of their pizzas and it was very good.  The crust was thin and crispy with good flavor, and the arugala and prosciutto were perfect toppings.  I was able to steal a few bites of the soup of the day from one of my friends.  It was a roasted garlic soup with squid, the broth was rich and hearty and the soup was satisfying.  One of my friends had the burger, served with 3 types of mushrooms and sweet gorgonzola.  He immediately declared it the best burger in Philadelphia, which means a lot coming from him since he has tried almost every joint in town and did not expect his current favorite to be dethroned.  \\n\\nThe wine list is impressive and definitely has something for every budget.  I can't wait to come back for happy hour, 5-7 every day with select wines and appetizers for only 5 bucks.  Looking forward to seeing the direction this place takes.\"\n",

I have since picked up the dress, free of stains and see what an AWFUL job was done on the alterations.  There are at least 10 stitches visible on the outside of the dress.

The hosts and hostesses have a superior class of presentation when seeing you and offering menu ideas and choices. They were even kind to my 6 8 and 10 year old while they were deciding what they wanted to eat for brunch today. The taste buds of children definitely challenged the menu here at Milktooth. The complex flavors and different variety of seasonings and spices and herbs that are used in their dishes definitely compliment the palate to help you explore your own taste buds as an adult, but for children simple pancakes eggs and bacon will do just fine. This place gave wonderful service to my children by providing them with such items minus the pancakes. I will return here again maybe with a little bit of a higher age bracket child where they understood more about complex flavors and spices and herbs. Their menu choices suit the need for those who want to get away from the normal food chains that are available all the time.

We had the beer battered green beans, and the batter was the best I've tasted. They came with an aioli, which was also very tasty. After we had been there a while, we decided to get the cassoulet: she was a little skeptical at first, but was very glad once it arrived.

I would have preferred the old deli way-sliced cabbage, red and green pepper and onions. The cole slaw was too creamy and definately not made in house. The pickles were just a little too overdone for my taste. The bowls and plates were so small that you either could only get two small pickles on the plate or go back for multiple helpings.

If you have a nut allergy you need watch out, most of them have nuts in them. If you don't want any of their specialities, you can always just choose a flavor custard and add your own toppings. They have toppings to cater to most if not all patrons! \\n\\nParking during the summer and the busier times is terrible. There is just too many people and the parking lot cannot accommodate. I recommend parking across the street at the bank and walking across. There is street parking, but that's usually taken as well. \\n\\nAs for prices, everything is decently priced and I feel is equivalent to what you get. The quality of their product is superb and they have a handful of ingredients that are certified kosher, if anyone is interested. \\n\\nYou won't be disappointed to visit, I promise!\"\n",

      " 'I desperately want to love Honeydeux, but after repeat visits I find myself more often than not only eating half my wraps and feeling slightly disappointed with the bubble tea. I\\'ve tried quite a few things on the menu, at this point, so I don\\'t think it\\'s just case of what I\\'m ordering. \\n\\nThe ingredients they use to make the wraps all seem pretty fresh, but something about the way everything blends is...odd. The Chipotle Chicken Wrap, for example, tastes overwhelmingly of the (very sugary/sweet) Chipotle sauce, and very little like anything else. There\\'s plenty of shredded chicken (good!) but it\\'s difficult to taste the cheese, and the vegetables appear only sparingly. The lettuce is kind of limp, but I guess you can expect that in a warm wrap. It\\'s wrapped in such a way that it\\'s pretty difficult to eat burrito-style (today, my wrap was huge, and came kind of squished down into a wrapped up panini lookin\\' thing?) and given its size, would I think benefit from being cut in half. Arguably, I could do this for myself at home, but when you\\'re marketing yourself as a convenient dine-in/take-out restaurant, making your food as easy to eat on-the-go as possible is, I think, important. Other wraps I\\'ve had have been similarly weird in terms of the flavor palette, too saucy or too dry, and always strangely sweet. Since I think of Honeydeux as my \\'healthy\\' take out alternative during the work week, this is a bit disappointing. \\n\\nPersonally, I do love all the drinks/teas/smoothies I\\'ve had here. Again, they are very, very sweet. I would agree/echo the reviewers who felt that the drinks were not sufficiently explained on the chalk board or the menu. Today I very specifically asked for a peach bubble TEA, since I read a previous review where the owner responded and suggested one ask specifically for the tea product, if one expected milk tea. Maybe I should have added \\'milk\\', but since the menu just says \"mango\" under a big headed entitled \"bubble tea,\" I figured that would be sufficient. What I got is blended ice with mango syrup - EXTREMELY sugary/sweet. To me, this isn\\'t in any way, shape, or form bubble tea. I\\'ve had more success with the thai tea (which is definitely milk tea), and the coconut flavor, which is I think just coconut milk blended with ice, but at least is milky. Having a section on the menu differentiating between blended ice smoothies and milk teas would be great. Do they even offer tea-based drinks that aren\\'t milky or straight up icees? I don\\'t know. The menu doesn\\'t tell me. \\n\\nThat said, my mango icee with tapioca was tasty, and to me, the tapioca boba was fresh and tasty - just the right amount of chewy. Reviewers are right; it is served warm. If this isn\\'t your thing, you may not like Honeydeux. Personally it doesn\\'t bother me and I quite like the variant in texture and temperature, when paired with the cold drink. \\n\\nIn short, it\\'s a so/so place to grab a snack that is healthier than a cheeseburger (by virtue of containing vegetables and giving you the option of wheat pita instead of white). I\\'m sure I\\'ll eat there again, but I do think there\\'s room for improvement if they want to really take off as a healthy take-out sandwich shop on the Magazine strip.'\n",

I wanted to go local when it came to ordering my wedding flowers, so I did some research and ended up choosing Dorignac's for the value.  I tried them out for my bridal portraits, when I needed a small dummy bouquet for pictures.  They were able to stay within a specific price range I had given them and I was more than happy with the finished product.\\n\\nWhen I called in the flowers for the big day (boutonnieres, corsages, baby's breath and my bouquet), they were just as responsive and the total was very, very reasonable.  The lady taking my order was so sweet and I was able to prepay over the phone after being referred to a manager.  As someone who was coming in from out of town and had multiple people picking up parts of my order, this made the day run much smoother!  Even when I threw the curveball of needing the bouquet and boutonniere ready before the rest of the flowers, they were more than gracious and were able to accomodate me.\\n\\nMy bouquet this time around was even more beautiful than the portrait session and is currently sitting on my dining room table in a bud vase.  I'd definitely reccomend Dorignac's to any New Orleans bride on a budget!\"]\n"

The bread is hearty and filling. The pairing with the tomato was a perfect combination. Best part, this sandwich is only $7.50. I have fallen in love...with a sandwich.\\n\\nI got to taste test friend's dishes, which included the chocolate waffles and biscuits and gravy. The chocolate waffles taste like chocolate cake and are slathered in chocolate syrup. This is not breakfast, this is diabetes on a plate and it tastes oh so good. You will crash from a sugar high afterward, but if you want to indulge your sweet tooth, this would be the meal. I also have to give major props to 3 Sisters for offering gravy that has turkey sausage instead of pork. As a non-pork eater who loves biscuits, this ingratiated the restaurant to me before I even got my meal. \\n\\nI got to see dishes as they came by and the two that shocked me the most was the pancakes and the breakfast burrito. Both were HUGE! The pancakes were about the size of my head. The people partaking in those meals did not finish their plates. \\n\\nIf you only have two breakfast/lunch meals while in Indy, I would highly suggest this being one of them.\"\n",

      " 'This is my first Yelp rating ever.  I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  But, this experience and meal was TERRIBLE!  We went to celebrate our son\\'s 21st.  He was looking forward to the lasagna his grandmother had been hyping.  We had reservations for 6pm on a Friday for 6 people.  The restaurant was 1/2 full.  They seated us right away in a dark corner under cheap blacklights.  It must have been so we didn\\'t notice how dirty it was.  The walls are scuffed and filthy like they haven\\'t been washed down or painted in years.  They had no table cloths, the silverware was the same quality as the Dollar Tree... no, that insults the Dollar Tree.  The floor is gymnasium/hospital vynal squares, dirty and scuffed.  Then, we waited.  It took 10 minutes to get the drink order.  We had three iced teas, one wine, and a coffee.  It took 15 minutes to get the drinks and no one had taken our order.  When they brought the drinks, the waitress couldn\\'t remember who ordered what.  The so-called glass of wine barely reached half full ... $6.  The coffee didn\\'t come out until 15 minutes after the other drinks were served.  They give you garlic bread at the tables.  They cut one 6-inch hogie roll into six, 2\" squares (one for each of us).  When I questioned the skimpy portion, the waitress said that was all she was allowed to bring for our size table.  She said she\\'d refill it, and to her credit did so.  They took our food order around 6:30.  I ordered chicken parmesan with stuffed shells, my husband got shrimp and artichoke linguine, two people ordered lasagna, one personal pizza and one shrimp and scallop Alfredo.  It took another 40 minutes to get the food.  I could have made pasta and pizza from scratch in that time.  The pasta tasted like it came from a box.  My \"chicken parmesean\" was the size of  my small palm, drowned in sauce.   There were only two shells.  If I\\'m being generous, the shells had a tablespoon of cheese in each shell.   To get to the chicken I had to wade through the sauce.  I gave up and just flipped the chicken over.  I didn\\'t see any breading.  I asked the waitress who told me that they don\\'t bread their chicken parmesan.   Since the breading is where you are supposed to get the parmesan, then, it wasn\\'t labeled correctly.  Then, I did something else that I have never done before (I\\'m 46).  I sent my food back and refused to let them re-try.  I had zero desire to wait again.  This meal was priced at $17.  I told them to remove it from the bill.  They did. My husband\\'s meal was underseasoned, runny and 95% pasta with 5 shrimp and 1 artichoke heart cut into quarters. This was $15.  As I said, we were in a dark corner.  My husband couldn\\'t see his plate well.  On the third shrimp he got concerned that the temperature was off.  So, he got better light and found it was raw.  His entire plate was exposed to raw seafood...not sushi.  He sent his back and we had them remove it from the bill.  My mother-in-law,  my husband and I all had salads.  They put my mother-in-law\\'s rectangle 8x4 salad plate over her 3\" round bread plate.  The salad had no tomatoes or croutons.  The onion was in a wedge still connected together.  There was one weird piece of pepperoni on the side.  That salad was $6.  The pizza my one son had he didn\\'t like.  He\\'s 13... There is no such thing as bad pizza to him.  The ONLY positive thing was that my son and mother-in-law enjoyed the lasagna.  I will never ever ever or ever take my family there again.  Finally, the table behind us said they thought they\\'d get better sauce from a can.  They had come up from Bisbee to celebrate their anniversary.  He had also sent his food back and refused to accept a replacement.  That was unfortunate for them, but validating for us.  We, both tables, explained to the server that we didn\\'t hold her accountable for the failures in the back.  She was still in tears because she had wanted us to all enjoy our special evenings. This review doesn\\'t cover everything. I\\'d like to forget, but now my hubby is nausous.  My husband sent the owner an email about this.  Next time Mama Louisa\\'s on Craycroft.'\n",

I brought my dog Slim in for his first appointment a couple months ago. I returned to the practice just a few weeks ago for Slim - he had a corneal ulcer. I saw Dr. Asklof and she was just WONDERFUL! She completed a thorough exam for Slim, went over a treatment plan and estimate with me, and his ulcer cleared by the time I came in for my 1 week recheck. Dr. Asklof was very comforting when I expressed my worries to her about how I was leaving Slim with a sitter for the week since I was traveling. She was very professional and practical, but also very warm and welcoming and made the whole experience feel like an open conversation with a friend. I am also a veterinary student and have had my share of experiences in practices before - I can say with confidence that this is definitely a top notch hospital! The whole place is very clean and sanitary. The staff is very welcoming - the vet tech that saw me for my initial appointment months ago just came in to say hi to me and see how Slim was doing (even though she wasn't my appointment vet tech this time around). Slim can also be dog aggressive which makes me concerned when I bring him in for appointments, however the set up of this hospital was very conducive for avoiding situations that would make Slim nervous or susceptible to have an incident with other dogs. The reception staff was also very friendly, were very accommodating to schedule my appointments with and gave a follow up call the next day to check in on Slim! HIGHLY recommend this place, and Slim and I will happily be customers (hopefully not too frequent for Slim's sake) in the future.\"\n",

When the waiter came to take our order, I pointed out the thread, presumably from a kitchen towel or napkin, in my water and asked for a new glass. That request went ignored until I had to ask another server. The waiter also never offered a refill of coffee, although he did bring one when asked. It isn't so much that we wouldn't return. We would; after all the eggs were cooked properly and the vegetables we asked for instead of potatoes were decently prepared. But, we certainly wouldn't rush back and we wouldn't bring friends to this incarnation of what used to be a standout restaurant.\"\n",

The blistered tomatoes were good but didn\\'t seem to belong on the plate. Butter poached lobster claws were perfectly cooked and it was a good balance not only of flavor but also quantity of lobster to risotto. My favorite dish of the meal.\\n\\nThird course: Lobster Tail Creole\\nThis should have been my favorite course but the lobster was over cooked and rubbery.

      "[\"Coming here I did not have high expectations, being that it is a franchise restaurant. I figured that I would have received run of the mill standard quality Italian food, however Carrabba's failed to even meet that. The food was definitely frozen, had a very similar taste to chef Boyardee or Stouffer's. \\nAs far a service goes, we certainly felt rushed, you could feel that the goal of the server was to turn the tables as fast as possible. We were nudged to order our apps at the same time as our drinks, it was so rushed I was unable to even read through the wine list before being asked if I was ready to order. Appetizers we're served promptly, salads were served before the apps were finished and entrees were served prior to salads being completed, which cause an extremely uncomfortable environment at the table. I thought the quality of the food was going to be the down fall of this establishment, but the service was worse then the food.\\nMy advice to you, is to drive right past this establishment and head over to the Olive garden. I'm not suggesting that the Olive garden is a magnificent Italian restaurant either, but it is leaps and bounds above Carrabba's. Writing this review I could not think of a single item of food or experience that would ever cause me to come back to Carrabba's.\"\n",

We ordered fried wontons as an appetizer; they changed their recipe for the better. They were larger, crispier and looked very appetizing. For our main dish, my husband ordered beef with wide noodles and I ordered chicken foo yong. The beef was much more tender than either of us  remember; it practically melted in your mouth. The foo yong were larger, they added more spices to the gravy, and the foo yong themselves were nice and fluffy while still being packed with chicken, bean sprouts, and vegetables.\\nOur waitress was super pleasant and says she loves to work here. To me, a happy waitress means you should expect the best service. She had a great conversation and is excited for the busier winter months, always a great sign.\\nOne thing I will mention is, this is a family owned restaurant; mom manages while dad cooks, so their small children are kept at a table away from patrons watching children's television. Occasionally they do run through the dining room, but it's very cute and they're pretty quiet; mind you we're a childless couple in our twenties saying this.

      " 'Best soup dumplings in St. Louis and actually most of the country!\\n\\nSTL Soup Dumplings was recommended to me by a friend and resident of St. Louis who used to live in Shanghai, China and who knew of my love for xialongbao.  I have been on the search for good dumplings since having them in Shanghai.  Love the branches of Din Tai Fung in Taiwan, Seattle/WA, and Santa Monica/CA.  And even though I have enjoyed them in other cities such as Boston, NYC, Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego, Honolulu...these by far have them all beat (except my beloved Din Tai Fung).\\n\\nMenu is limited.  Serving ONLY xialongbao.  Flavors include:  pork and crab, pork  chicken, beef, shrimp.  We tried an assortment.  While the pork and crab flavor was THE BEST pork and crab dumplings I have ever had, all of our favorite was the pork only XLB.  The flavor was clean and crisp.  The soup which bursts out of the skin delicious and well balanced.  The skin of the dumplings thin and near translucent.  My only disappointments were that no shredded ginger was served with the dumplings nor was there hot tea.  Knowing this I would just bring some along next time.\\n\\nYes, STL Soup Dumplings serves only xiaolongbao.  Still, if one wants a more varied menu one can easily dine at their sister, full service menued restaurant next door, \"Private Kitchen\".\\n\\nI have read in other reviews the complaint in price.  I get that this is St. Louis not Hawaii yet the amount of time and effort to make these babies is something I will not be undertaking anytime soon!  To learn how to make them in Shanghai one has to go to school to learn this art, and then have to become certified!  There are many just so so average versions out there.  The cost of all of that, then perfecting this dish...will lead me to visit STL Soup Dumplings whenever I am in town!\\n\\nLocated in a little strip mall in Olivette, just west of Chesterfield.  It is easy to find from the main road.  Same building as Private Kitchen.  Thank you Rhonda!  Thank you Dave!  Excellent recommendation!'\n",

The curtains are closed while you change but wide open during the massage, presumably so the instructors can observe the students. Ummmm, this did not make for a very relaxing environment and on top of that, the room was on the cool side. It would have been somewhat better if the curtains at least stayed closed during the massage and the instructors slipped in and out of the curtained areas to observe.

It was laughable listening to them try to convince me that what I have been trained to observe was wrong and that I did not know what I was talking about. What follows is only one part of my story. \\n\\nI was charged $2800 for an ECP protection plan when I purchased the coach.  I took the coach in to have the ECP protection applied which is basically just washing and hand waxing the vehicle with a special polymer coating to protect the paint. They stated that the work had been done but when I went to pick up the coach to my surprise the same love bugs that were on the upper section of the coach and on the mirrors when I delivered it to them were still there. I know this because I washed the windshield, hood and front grill of the truck before I dropped it off. I did not clean the upper section of the coach or the mirrors because of time restraints and I knew that they were going to wash it anyway.\\n\\nAdditionally, I observed that there was a still a thick layer of dirt still remaining on the upper back section of the coach. I knew the dirt was the same dirt that was on the coach when I dropped it off because it still had the S shape swirl I had put in the dirt the week before when I showed them they had not sealed the roof.  And that's another tail of work that was to be performed that wasn't. \\n\\nI immediately demanded to see a supervisor. Two supervisors from the service department tried extremely hard to convenience me that the coach had been completely washed and the ECP protection applied. They tried hard to explain that the love bugs that were currently on the coach were acquired during a test drive. They tried to convenience me that the dirt on the back was from the rain we had yesterday and that the handprints and S pattern in the dirt could have been put there by any of the workers when they were checking the coach.\\n\\nFunny they could not explain why the love bugs were only on the upper section of the coach and on the mirrors. No Love Bugs on the windshield and none on the grill or on the exposed side panels of the coach. I guess they were expecting me to believe that we have selective love bugs in Florida that only target certain areas of the coach when they want to die.\\n\\nI can only assume that they also wanted me to believe that rain only deposits dirt on specific sections of the coach as there was no dirt on the truck section or on the top of the window edges, bumpers etc. The rest of the vehicle was clean. \\n\\nThe evidence was clear that the ECP coating had never been applied. But they did their best to test my ignorance and try to convenience me it has been applied. \\n\\nBeing a mechanic for 40 + years and working at dealerships and body shops as a quality control technician. I know what a vehicle looks like and feels like after a polymer coating has been applied. The surface of the vehicle is as slick as glass and it has an electric feeling if you rub the back of your fingers lightly on the surface.\\n\\nOn my coach, there was no evidence anywhere that the coating had been applied. The paint was clean but it was still ruff from having a good coat of road grime. There only comment.  We're sorry you are not 100% satisfied.\\n\\nNo, I'm not even 10% satisfied. Of all the work that was done. I only found one item that was done properly. That accounts for the 10%\\n\\nThere are several more sides to this tale and all are bad. Good luck if you take your coach to the Tampa General RV dealership for work. I hope you get what you pay for. \\n\\nIt's just sad when you can't trust the dealership to do what you pay them to do. At over $200 per hour for labor, you should be able to expect perfection.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a service department to work on your coach. My, advise. Look elsewhere. There are several other RV dealerships in this same general area.\"\n",

      " \"I had a craving for pizza one Thursday night so I chose to give Pie Face Pizza a try; the atmosphere in Pie Face Pizza is fairly simple.  Because of it's location in the El Cortez Hotel (which is one of the oldest buildings still standing in downtown Reno) it has some features (like the tin tiles on the ceiling) dating back a bit.  Pie face has updated the décor though with granite tabletops and a nice big screen TV in their lounge area.  I really like what they did with the location and I think it lends well to the younger crowd that they are targeting.\\n\\nat Pie Face requires patrons to order in the back of the restaurant at the cash register and then the food is brought out by the staff.  So the back is precisely where I headed upon entering the building.  Once I arrived at the cash register I noticed their Thursday night date special which consists of a salad, two glasses of house wine, and two slices of pizza (either cheese or pepperoni) for $20.  Thinking this wasn't a bad deal I ordered it and just paid extra to get some more toppings.  I ordered my slice with BBQ sauce, chicken, pepperoni, and pineapple (I was also informed that you can't order more than four toppings on a slice because they told me it wouldn't cook properly).  My date ordered a slice with pineapple, sweet basil, and roasted garlic.  We also decided to get an order of garlic knots for $4.00.\\n\\nThe salad came first and it was out really quickly.  This salad was one of the most beautiful salads that I have ever seen!  And the best part is it tasted just as good as it looked!  The salad was composed of spring mix lettuce leaves, mushrooms, red bell pepper, red onion, black olives, grape tomatoes, toasted almonds, Pecorino, and a sweet basil vinaigrette (I'm salivating just thinking about it!).  The pizza and garlic knots came out before we could even make a big dent in the salad.  The pizza was good; it was better than many places I've been to but a notch under the best places I've tried.  The garlic knots were pretty unimpressive to me and didn't taste like anything special; they were basically knotted pizza dough with the tiniest smidgen of garlic taste.  I was also fairly disappointed with the amount of marinara that came with them; it was gone after two knots and there were six knots total.  I had also requested some ranch and that container came half full.\\n \\nOverall I thought that this meal was a really good value and great tasting I will definitely be back for the salad!

      " \"My SO and I decided to check out IndeBlue for lunch this past Sunday and it also happened to be restaurant week. We came around 1130 and the host seated us right away since the restaurant opened at 11 on Sundays. Our server came by to greet us soon after and explained the restaurant week menu along with few recommendations. He was very knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. The restaurant's interior was cozy and intimate with a purple wallpaper and pretty lights/candles. For drinks, we got the chai sangria and spicy bloody mary. I liked the chai sangria a lot, your typical sangria with a touch of chai flavor. The spicy bloody mary was not our favorite and we would not get this again. The pepper taste was a bit too strong that it took away the overall flavor of the drink. For entree, we got chicken tikka makhani and masala dosa. The portions were generous and we were pretty full by the time desserts arrived. The chicken tikka makhani was my favorite. The coconut flavor curry flavor combined with the butter chicken was heaven! The safron rice added to the meal making it hard to resist myself from keep eating it. The masala dosa came with three sauces to dip and a roll up crepe like with fillings inside. It was authentic and each sauce added a nice flavor to the crepe. For a price of $20 during restaurant week, I thought it was so worth it. Great food at a decent price! Can't really beat that. Thanks IndeBlue for a great experience :)\"\n",
      " 'One word of advice, Amada and its portions are probably best suited for at least a party of four. That way, you can get a sampling of each item. The restaurant has a fairly diverse menu with lots of different options. But each platter provides about four servings. While we went ahead and ordered an assortment of platters for our party of 2, there were several dishes that I did not need a second or third helping of.\\n\\nRegardless, service was good. While firing away our list of dishes, the waitress slowed us down and suggested that 6 might be the most a party of 6 could finish. She was right. We barely touched course number 6. \\n\\nAll the food was flavorful. We got the cheese sampler and an assortment of meat dishes. However, our favorites actually were the vegetarian dishes. The spinach and beans were smoky. The asparagus was perfectly done and the poached egg complemented the dish quiet well.\\n\\nAmada serves some pretty solid food.'\n",

      " \"I was pretty disappointed by my latest visit to Smokey Bones.  It had been 4-5 years since my last visit and I was really looking forward to it.  I had heard of changes made due to new ownership several years ago but I am not sure things changed for the better.\\n\\nI will start with prices.  They are high, too high for barbecue.  We came on a Sunday afternoon and after we received the menus, I asked if they had a lunch menu.  Apparently, you can only order lunch specials during the week.  A little disappointing since I would really only be visiting on the weekend anyway as I am sure most people would.  So you effectively need to order from the (more expensive) dinner menu.  So what does this mean?  Pulled pork barbecue plate and two sides - 13.99, cheapest thing on the menu - small pulled pork sandwich with a small side - 9.99.\\n\\nSo moving past prices, when the pulled pork sandwich arrived, I found it incredibly bland even a little soggy.  The fries were okay but it is hard to screw that up.\\n\\nService was okay but not super friendly. My questions about the lunch menu took a lot of probing to find out why there was no lunch menu and maybe the realization that we were only ordering two pulled pork sandwiches and thus no larger order (tip) was disappointing to her.\\n\\nI won't be back.  There is so much better quality barbecue in Tampa for better prices.  I highly recommend Holy Hog or Leeroy Selmons instead.\"\n",

The staff matched the atmosphere; lawn chairs and metal tables. The only thing close to authentic was the dark meat, half chicken with curry spices, listed almost as an after thought on the menu. The yams as a side were also good. I enjoyed it, but it was the only thing interesting on the menu, which is why I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars rather than 2.\"]\n"

I had the biscuits with gravy and everyone else at my table had different variations of omelettes. All of our meals came with home fries that were pretty good as well.

They sang, they danced, and made us laugh the whole time we were there. As for the drinks my friend had a Bloody Mary she couldn't stop raving about.

She knew how to cut my fine, wavy, multiple-cowlick ridden, hair perfectly into long the layered haircut that I wanted. And she did it as a dry cut. Normally she wouldn't do that, but I spontaneously wanted to color my hair, which she was happy to squeeze in--if I would agree to the dry cut, and for the new intern to give me a blow-out afterward.  No fuss, no drama! Yeni was happy to oblige, and I was happy to get my hair style experimented on by the new girl. Two and a half months later, my hair still looks great, even as it grows out. No complaints! Thanks Yeni! \\n\\nI also recommend booking time into your appointment for any color requests before you show up for an appointment, and not do what I did.

Second dish, a transitional Chinese dish from my hometown (one of my favorite dish); so I figured I should try this place too. The original and the right way was supposed to use pork belly, BUT of course, since this restaurant can come up with 60% non meat and 40% meat, is it not surprised they used the WRONG meat and \"claimed\" that IS the transitional method like seriously?! How are you going to say your method is traditional way and know it better than me when I born and raised eating that dish....? I 100% do not recommend this place. The food is not cooked in the traditional way and they really know how to rip customers off with their \"60% non meat and 40% meat\" policy....'\n",

Shockingly, it had nothing to do with our son, who was uncharacteristically calm and well-behaved. The service was also not the problem. I believe that our waitress was named Alexis and she was fantastic-- extremely kind and accommodating.\\n\\nThe meal that we were served last night, though, merits a one-star review and a firm declaration that we won\\'t be going back:\\n\\nWe had:\\n\\nAPPETIZERS\\n- We both ordered French Onion soup. It\\'s hard to serve a bowl of melted cheese that isn\\'t somewhat tasty, but this really could have used some more seasoning. It was bland.\\n- Mexican chicken spring rolls. We actually ordered this for our son, but he refused to take a single bite. We had it wrapped up and ate it later. It wasn\\'t terrible, but nor was it anything that I wouldn\\'t have expected to get at, say, a TGI Friday\\'s. It also did not need the huge mound of shredded iceberg. \\n- \"Jumbo shrimp\" wrapped in bacon with horseradish sauce. I put this in quotes because they weren\\'t jumbo in any respect whatsoever. I was served three very modestly sized and very overcooked shrimp. Somehow this costs $12. They should be embarrassed to be serving this.\\n\\nENTREES\\n- My wife ordered a burger. She wanted it medium, but it came out burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. It was not a good burger at all, although the shoestring fries were tasty.\\n- I ordered a trout special that was indescribably disgusting. It came in a lemon caper sauce that was thick and coagulated and gnocchi that were slimy, nasty little balls of incompetence. For some reason there was a really thick dab of pesto on top of the fish that was incredibly salty and awful. This was truly terrible entree.\\n\\nI definitely would have complained about this meal-- which, with two drinks, somehow cost over $100-- but I thought that it was obnoxious enough to bring a toddler to a nice restaurant, so I kept my mouth shut.\\n\\nNote to the management: If, on a Friday night, virtually every customer in your restaurant is 800 gazillion years old, it\\'s because your food sucks. Their taste buds are dead. And hopefully this once very good (but never great) restaurant will die soon as well.']\n",

They were breaded and fried like chicken nuggets, but they were a little chewier like calamari. The mango-habenero sauce came on the side and was pretty spicy. We got ketchup for my one and a half year old who ate those nuggets like they were chicken.\\n\\nOur dinner portions were quite large so we shared with the baby. I had the BBQ pork chops which were good, with creamed corn and fried okra. The creamed corn was delicious and a little sweet. The fried okra came out in nugget form and my son loved them. My husband had the ribs, and he definitely had the best meal. Best ribs I've ever had! His sides were the sweet potato casserole, which we both liked, but our son ate most of it. He also got the spicy onion rings, which had a nice fresh breading, but were not that spicy. I loved them because they reminded me of a Bloomin' onion but husband didn't care for them because he wanted more of a traditional onion ring.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the banana foster bread pudding with ice cream. It was amazingly good. More of a bread pudding w/ homemade ice cream, and less banana foster (except the sauce). Overall, great meal and we will be back!

      "['I found SBWineTours on a google search of limo tours of Santa Barbara (and surrounding county) wineries and vineyards. A few points on the website piqued my interest:\\n- one rate, no add-on\\'s for fuel, etc. It was one hourly price, plus tip.\\n- customized tours. they would take you to any winery you wanted to go to. The rates are quoted hourly on the website, but you are actually charged on the quarter of an hour. You are encouraged to pay by cash or check, to keep their operating costs down for credit card charges.\\n- in-limo karaoke machine, by reservation. I ended up reserving it, but we never saw it or used it.\\n\\nI sent an email to inquire availability on a particular date. There was an auto-responder that replied, explaining they were out of the office, and would reply within 24 hours. If it was urgent, a phone number was provided.\\n\\nAbout 14 hours later, around noon the next day, I received a template email explaining the amenities and prices. It explained the \"Sideways Tour\" was most popular, visiting the wineries featured in the movie \"Sideways\". The email offered to recommend other wineries based on my wine tastes, so I asked for suggestions for a wine drinker who enjoys Syrahs, Pinot Noirs, and Merlots. I was simply given a link to Santa Barbara County winery lists. 3 lists, each with at least 60 wineries on it. I had no clue how to narrow my search. I tried to find some wineries and create some sort of ranking system, and ended up combining most of SB Wine Tour\\'s Sideways Tour with a few that seemed popular on wine forums, and crossed my fingers. Jerry at Santa Barbara Wine Tours reassured me that I didn\\'t have to get back to him immediately with the list, but nevertheless, I sent him some list the night before we arrived.\\n\\nWe met Jerry from SB Wine Tours at the Amtrak station, since we were visiting without a car. He was on time, and easy to find in the parking lot. Jerry looked sharp, wearing a suit, and welcomed us to Santa Barbara. We hopped in the limo, which had two wine glasses sitting on the seats, waiting for us. They were etched with \"Santa Barbara Wine Tours\" and the website, and they were ours to keep. I was excited about coming home with many glasses, as I had read most wineries let you keep the glass as part of the tasting fee. Jerry pointed out bottled water, and a bottle of champagne.\\n\\nWe sped off to Solvang, to the first winery. After we parked, we were instructed to take our glasses with us to each winery. We were a bit confused, but figured since he was going to comp us for wine tastings, it was OK. He introduced us to the host at the wine tasting bar, and left to go sit in the car. We enjoyed our wine tasting, and hopped back in the limo with our dirty glasses, trying to hold them upright in the car so we wouldn\\'t drip red stains all over the limo or ourselves.\\n\\nWe got to the next winery, and he parked out front. He let us out of the car, and shooed us to the front door, but waited in the car. We were pretty embarrassed carrying in our own wine glasses, stained with the leftovers of the last tasting. We saddled up to the bar, and apologized for our dirty glassware. The host offered their own glassware, and we gladly accepted. The wine was great, they even cleaned out our dirty SB Wine Tour glasses before we left!\\n\\nFinally, we headed to the last spot, to have lunch. Jerry brought us up to the VIP tasting room, which was empty, and we enjoyed more tasting and a delicious lunch. We both decided we were too sauced to continue wine tasting for the day, so we decided we would ask Jerry to take us back to the hotel. I was a little nervous, and started doing calculations in my buzzed head as to how much I would pay for 8 hours of service (my reservation), how much I would pay for the hours I spent, (closer to 5), and how much to settle if he started to complain.\\n\\nWe got to the limo, I put my fiancée in the car, and I asked Jerry to take us to the hotel. He asked if everything was OK with the winery, and I said we over-did it, if he would please take us to the hotel. He kind of cocked his head, and said \"you\\'re the boss\" and got in the car. I really couldn\\'t tell if he was upset.\\n\\nWhen we got to the hotel, 45 minutes later, he gave me the paperwork, with 4.75 hours of service. That was a nice outcome.\\n\\nOverall, he performed as advertised: drove us to wineries, and hooked us up with some comp\\'ed tastings. I wasn\\'t particularly connected to him, he didn\\'t make detailed suggestions and didn\\'t seem passionate, but he did know all the roads and wineries and got us safely around Santa Barbara. Good for the price,  and good if you already know where you want to go, and aren\\'t looking for conversation or a guide to the area.'\n",

When I got my order I was a little surprised because I expected my order to be a flatbread type pizza, but it's actually a wrap. Nonetheless, it was very tasty and I was happy with my choice except for the diablo fries. I absolutely love spicy food, but these fried were just too hot. They were super dark red, having been totally smothered in spicy seasoning that you could barely see the original fry underneath. I had one and my mouth wasn't burning at first, but after an additional two fries I couldn't bear the heat any longer and had to give up. My coworker said she had had the fries before and they weren't that hot, so she tried a few and felt the same way. We felt bad having to leave a full plate of fries behind but we just couldn't have more than a couple. Overall it was a good lunch and we both got out of there for under $25 which was great!\"\n",

That ruined my meal, bleh.\\n\\nI figured that might be a fluke, so I gave it another shot this weekend while I was out shopping at KOP.  The clam chowder lacked something, but I'm not sure what.  Everyone else seated around us got rolls, except us, and I had to ask the server twice for ours.  They didn't arrive until after our entrees were almost polished off.  The rest of the food was ok, but seriously I'd rather wait an hour or two to eat at Cheesecake Factory, than eat at Legal Sea Foods ever again.\"\n",

Whether I've been hosting a large dinner there or going for date night I am always impressed by the service and everything coming out of the ki\\n\\nUpdate: I've been going to Old School countless times since it first opened. I loved it through October 2016, when they had their original executive chef and kitchen staff they later ousted in a very unprofessional way. When they reopened with the new chef things had changed, but I continued going. Since the new chef took over they have made numerous changes to how they operate. They got rid of the original community night which included lower priced entrees and drinks (they have since brought back a new iteration of this idea but with far less food options). They went from having reservations at brunch to no reservations at brunch and back to reservations, all without any word on social media or their website about what had changed. Over the last three months, the service has really taken a turn for the worst. Dinner took 2 hours last time I went with a friend due to not being checked on regularly. Additionally, when they are closed for a private event there is no way of knowing unless you see their Instagram story the day it is posted or try to make a reservation only for open table to tell you there are no reservations available that day. However, given they are not a reservation-required restaurant this can be incredibly problematic. Also, I can count on one hand the number of times someone has actually been standing at the host stand when I walk in, and multiple times I've had to wait 5+ minutes for a front of house staff member to return to their station and then seat us. They've been closed three out of four Saturdays in the past month, which I find less than ideal for a restaurant that is only open Wednesday-Sunday (and four of those days are only open for a single meal service). Will I keep going? Likely yes, because I happen to live in the neighborhood. Would I like to see serious improvement in their communication with patrons and service? Undoubtedly yes.

      " \"I ate here yesterday with my wife and brother, and got the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life. Shortly after we left my wife and I started having stomach aches, and I spent the entire night in the bathroom going back and forth with diarrhea and vomit. The next day, I still feel nauseous - not exactly how I planned spending the holidays with my family. The worst part, my wife called to let the employees know that they should throw away their Almandrado because it gave us food poisoning, and they couldn't care less. My wife explicitly said we were not asking for a refund or anything, we were just trying to make sure no one else gets sick. They dismissed us saying we probably have the flu. We tried to reiterate that the symptoms came on very quickly after eating at their restaurant and it only affected the people who ate the almandrado. They wouldn't listen and just said we have the flu. So I'm posting this here to try and warn people to think twice about eating here. I'm a young guy in good health, I can't imagine what would happen if an elderly person got that same food poisoning I had, it would probably send them to the hospital. (It was honestly VERY bad, I was throwing up so hard it came out of my nose). Don't make the mistake we did - if you try and go to Mi Nidito and it's packed, and you look across the street and see Guillermo's and think it's a good option, maybe just drive somewhere else instead.\"\n",

First appointment included a few photos to document my current alignment and then a short video to cover chiro care (helpful if this is all new to you). \\n\\nUpon meeting Dr. M she was friendly, even though she did confirm I had received chiropractic adjustments in the past, she still treated me as a new patient. Explaining details to me and everything she was doing through the initial appt.\\n\\nDuring my second visit Dr. M reviewed her findings with me and also discussed the care she recommends for her findings. Again she used charts and diagrams to really help me understand exactly what was happening with my body and how she would anticipate the course of treatment over time will help. \\n\\nAfter my adjustment I proceeded to the therapy area where I laid for about 10 min on a table that rolled up and down my back to set the adjustment I just had done. \\n\\nOverall I cannot say enough good things about this office. Their focus and care for total wellness, including infant and children is reassuring because I know that I can continue my care with this practice once my baby arrives. \\n\\nLastly, I really like their effort on education.

(A little too much spice for me). \\n\\nThe wings were so meaty and had a nice crisp and the sauce was perfect! They let you pick 2 options to start off with and you can basically eat as much as you want and as many flavors as you want. I shared the 24 wings with my daughter and we ended up eating only about 12 of them, so we had some leftovers. \\n\\nEveryone at my table was stuffed off of their 13-15 wings and couldn't finish all 24 that was brought out first. My sisters boyfriend ate 2 servings and got his money worth. \\n\\nThe beer was also fairly priced with the wings. I love the fact that since it's a restaurant I was able to bring my daughter and at the time we went it wasn't full of a bunch of drunks and wasn't loud or crowded. \\n\\nThe waitress was on point and very helpful as well! \\n\\nSo pleased with today's visit and would be sure to remember that Monday's are wing night.

      " 'So, I was debating writing a review of this place after my last negative experience.  That which consisted of not being able to find a clean table, and then watching an employee wipe the tables down with a wad of dry napkins, spreading the germs from one table to another.  Oh, and she used the same hand for the napkins that she used to pick garbage off the floor.  (Did I mention she also was working the register and dishing out food?)  I contacted Wendy\\'s about my observation, they offered an apology and tried to buy me off with a free \"combo meal.\"  I respectfully declined.\\n\\nI should have had more common sense than to visit this location again.  (Lesson learned, complete idiotic moment in deciding to try again on my part.)  This time I went through the drive-through lane, and ordered a meal, my drink of choice being lemonade.  I paid (seemed a bit higher than I had anticipated), and drove off.  Wondering how I could have mis-calculated such a minuscule purchase, I checked my receipt (which they tend not to give you unless asked.)  Well, these crooks automatically upgraded my lemonade to \"Premium\" lemonade for .40 cents.  They never asked me, or informed me, that I had a choice.  Their college graduate taking the order made this decision for me.  Since this was an upgrade, there obviously is a standard drink, which I assumed I was going to receive.  You know, the one that comes from a drink dispenser next to Coke, Sprite, etc.  Come to find out, this is \"special\" lemonade that is different.  Shame on me for not paying attention to their little electronic order screen, guess I should watch that next time.  (I assume the upgrade would be on that order screen?)\\n\\nI wasn\\'t going to waste my time driving back and talk to some ignoramus about the .40 cents.  Instead, I chose to write this review.  I believe this business practice of them upgrading an item to a premium product, at an additional price, with no conversation with the consumer, is unfair, and certainly deceptive to their patrons.  What else are they hiding from us?  How many times have they gotten away with this little swindle in the past?  Buyers Beware of Wendy\\'s!'\n",

      "[\"By far the best Mexican food in town.  The atmosphere is quiet and the bar is pretty mice too.\\n\\nThe above is about a year old.  They have really weird hours now since they closed and reopened.  Haven't been able to catch them open lately.\"\n",
      " 'I\\'m going to have to go with my heart and dissent from the other positive comments here about EAT cafe. The concept behind the restaurant - a pay what you can afford situation that uses funds to run a variety of programs in the city (visit their website for more info) - is great. Unfortunately the actual food and experience are sub-par.\\n\\nPerhaps my friend and I visited on a very off night, but the overall experience was really uneven. The venue is quite small, with perhaps ten tables for two. When we arrived at around 6PM on a Wednesday, there were only three occupied tables. Despite the fact that there were numerous tables with table settings ready to go, and no one else waiting to be seated, we were asked to take a seat and it took 10 minutes for someone to seat us at an actual table.\\n\\nThere were two servers working, a gentleman and a lady. The lady seemed quite competent but she was not especially attentive. There was no check back visit during our meal to see how we were doing, and any time we needed anything, we did have to flag someone down. The gentleman who was also waiting tables seems very green. Perhaps this is his first time waiting tables? He made a variety of awkward mistakes throughout the night that were distracting. At one point a woman who was one of a party of three arrived and asked to be seated next to us, so two tables for two were pushed together and she sat to wait for her companions. A few minutes later this waiter came over and without a word just started pushing our table that we were actively seated and dining at over, and then re-separated the other woman\\'s two tables. She had to explain WHY they were pushed together, and then he had to push everything back to where it was. It was very weird.\\n\\nIt took over half an hour for our entrees to be brought to our table. I understand this is a small operation, but this was simply unreasonable. A table of six was seated about 10 minutes AFTER we arrived, and their entrees began coming out BEFORE ours, so I don\\'t know WHAT was going on there. Very frustrating.\\n\\nIn terms of the food... it seems like Eat Cafe is aiming to serve trendy dishes that push toward gourmet, but they almost all fall quite flat. You have your choice of two starting items (soup or salad,) three entrees, and three desserts. These rotate weekly. In the instance of our visit, each one was served with green beans and rice and beans. The estimated value of this meal is $15.\\n\\nTo start, we both had the Spicy Sweet Potato Soup With Greens. Essentially a sweet potato bisque, it was fairly good, but I\\'m not sure what the \"with greens\" entailed. It seemed to have a parsley sprig on top.\\n\\nMy dining partner ordered the Sautéed Chicken with Mushrooms and Artichokes. She said that it tasted fine, but was a little salty; and if there were aritchokes in there, they were very well hidden indeed. I ordered the Black-Eyed Pea Fritters with Green Tomato Remoulade. The portion size of these fritters was abysmally small - perhaps the size of two small plums. To quote my dining partner, who tasted my dish: \"It tastes vegetarian.\" Though I found the small fritters tasty, the texture was unpleasant. As a Louisiana raised boy, I have to say the remoulade was nothing like any remoulade I\\'ve ever had. It was more like a generic spicy mayo.\\n\\nThe green beans were basically inedible. Truly, they had no flavor at all, and they were grossly undercooked. They seemed just shy of being raw to be perfectly frank. As for the rice and beans, though it was tasty, it really made no sense as a side dish for either of our entrees. I honestly would have preferred to have an entree of just a large serving of the rice and beans over what I actually ate.\\n\\nThe third entree, which we did not order, was a Fried Fish with Fried Green Tomatoes. As a Southerner I couldn\\'t pass up the chance to try those fried green tomatoes, so I ordered them as an extra side. They forgot them, but brought them out once I mentioned them again. Ironically this was the best item of the meal for me. They were huge, delicious green tomatoes in a unique but tasty batter: perfectly seasoned and an ideal texture.\\n\\nThe desserts were actually a hit. My companion had the white chocolate macadamia cookie with vanilla ice cream, while I had the pound cake, which was served with a thin berry sauce and whipped cream. The pound cake was really delicious.\\n\\nOne of the biggest gripes we had with Eat Cafe is that for all it\\'s attempt of feeling upscale, there\\'s a certain lack of sophistication. Neither of our servers could pronounce the word \"macadamia\" and one of them referred to the spice cumin as \"come in.\" This hardly matters, but what I\\'m alluding to is that it feels like they\\'re trying to be something they\\'re not, and it\\'s to the detriment of the atmosphere. The young lady working the front counter/reception also seemed incredibly bored and mildly annoyed for the duration of our meal.\\n\\nEat Cafe is a great idea that needs a lot of work.'\n",

We don't know if the fish was bad or it was not cooked properly or what the cause was, however this was not okay! Good luck when eating here.

I walked to what seem to be the shift leader/manager to remain them we needed service and she was apologetic, nice, and attentive.  Service after was good.  As for the food, the udon noodle tasted authentic (better than most catch all sushi places).  The 3 rolls we got, don't remember which, was good quality.  Overall, not a bad place (except that one hiccup).  Craving somewhat satisfied.\"\n",

I end up going to the wrong location my first time trying to find this place . When I called Terra she was flat out IGNORANT to me , I was apologetic and trying to explain to her I was not given the proper location , she insists on blaming everything on me , talking over me and interrupting me . She told me I had 5 min to get to her salon or she wasn\\'t doing my lashes . I got upset and literally had to beg this woman and explain to her ignorant self that I took off work to come get my lashes done and that she could have a little consideration . She told me I \"better get there\" . She continues to get ignorant and ghetto with me the whole time . I open one of her emails to get the second address , it was literally put in how it reads . I get to the address and call her outside , she continues to argue with me telling me that I put in the wrong address and was lost . Instead of being clear in the first place with me , or describing the location . Being that I was out of town and she knew this I think Terra purposely let me get lost and get smart with me just so I would miss my appointment and she could sit on her butt and make a free 50 dollars . Ms. Terra I hope you take that money and buy yourself Some customer service and respect .

The young lady sneered and said the owner doesn't like them to use plastic cups for iced espresso because people make iced lattes.  I replied that I don't drink milk but if I did and I wanted a latte I would have ordered that. She did relent and give me a paper cup. Her attitude reminded me of LaVa. Whatever.

There's plenty of path ways to walk but I wish they had more monuments/eye catchers to look at. During many holidays they usually have events here, from pancake breakfasts to viewing fireworks. You can also walk to the high level bridge from here and have an amazing view of the river and its parks. Parking can be a little bit of an issue but there are many bus routes and a train stop near by. During Christmas they decorate the trees and it looks pretty cool.

I know that's saying a lot for iced tea but it was really good, fresh brewed and perfectly sweetened when you mix half sweet half unsweet. The slider was hot, juicy and fresh. The bun was soft without being mushy and green chiles were gave the burger a warm heat that paired perfectly with the cheese. Now I can't wait to head back to Atomic Burger for a full sized Green Chile Burger or maybe just a couple of the sliders as they have some really great options.

There were a couple of little ones at this show because of the all ages status, and things went very well at first for them. \\n\\nThe great Canadian poet RC Weslowski was a riot, really funny, really incredible linguist who can slam with aplomb. Don't get me wrong, I loved his dirtier poetry, I am not a square this is what I wanted, but thinking for the children, we went from a giant cookie poem, to a poem about love, then out of nowhere we got sex haiku with highly graphic language and then one of the most vulgar poems I have ever heard about a truck driver and the dirty C was dropped at least 5 times and every other thing, it really stretches the all ages idea. \\n\\nPlease vet your acts a little better so kids don't get exposed to this.\\n\\nHowever, I still give mad respect to the poets and I did want to say something nice about the venue because its really really intimate. I sat in the middle and it felt like RC was speaking his awesome poems directly to me at times, as he occasionally stared right at me and it felt unbelievable. Then, another poet Xavier Cavazos stepped up and the intimacy of the venue allowed me to feel the palpable anger, sadness, and defiance in Xavier's fiery poetry. I would love Club Congress to book someone like Louie CK, or someone even edgier, I think this place would be incredible to watch comedy.\\n\\nI think 3 stars is fair for what I got but I want to go again and try some drinks and see some music and it could go to five very easily.\"\n",

I managed to stay warm with a chilled Syrah that was filled to the top, oh yeah. If you have never gone sailing, this adventure will give you a good idea of what it takes to be a sailor. If you ask nicely, the captain will let you pull ropes and help with sails.      \\n\\nFor an intimate time, Sunset Kidd Sailing is perfect to enjoy with that special someone.

I do believe reviews should be based first and foremost on food quality, but it\\'s a big plus that the manager and staff are so caring about their customers and image. \\n\\nAgain, the pizzas were great. We tried the farmers daughter (a breakfast pizza with eggs and drizzled with hot sauce) which quickly became my new favorite. The gnarlic, which had a white sauce base with garlic sauce and pesto, was also delicious with a strong but now overpowering garlic taste. Among a couple others we tried, only the pineapple jack, their version of a Hawaiian pizza, was unremarkable. However, across the board the ingredients were still fresh and the pizzas tasty with just the right amount of crispiness and balance of dough, sauce, and flavorful toppings. \\n\\nAlso worth a mention were the teas: the unsweetened lemongrass white peach tea was super refreshing and according to my friend \"like drinking a flower\" (in a good way!). While their sweet tea was also good, if you\\'re a fan of teas that aren\\'t pumped with sugar to the point of being basically soda, I\\'d definitely give it a try.'\n",

But hey, if you like eating blocks of salt then go ahead and enjoy. The real reason behind my review is not really the Dead Sea salinity level meat that you\\'re offered, but the horrible customer service and management that they have.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I went to the place on a holiday and were made to wait for half an hour at the door which is understandable if you\\'re busy and you don\\'t have a reservation minus the whole part where people without a reservation that arrived 10 or more minutes after us were seated before us. Oh well, right?! ... It gets better. \\n\\nWe know because were standing next to the hostess waiting and saw the whole thing so I went up and asked her nicely about our table, and was met with attitude in exchange and told to wait. Okay, well maybe she woke up on the wrong side of the bed; no big deal. \\n\\nExcept that she told her waitress to sit us at the \"far end end of the patio\" and there were many open seats there. We were seating at the end with no light and it was night time so we had to eat in the dark like animals and the meat services was not even coming to the end because we were so far back so we had to beg for meat to be brought to us as if we were stray animals. \\n\\nOn top of that our waiter took his sweet time to get to our table and didn\\'t bring water for over 10 minutes after he saw us. We saw him once more after that. Hope the poor thing is okay... Yeah but we saw plenty of him taking pictures of people at other tables. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t even swallow because I was very upset; one of the waiters or whoever he was came around and asked how everything was going and also had to bring us water since you know our waiter went AWOL so I said I was upset and he asked what was happening and I told him about the service of the whole night. He got another manager who asked what was wrong and I told him also and he didn\\'t even apologized just said \"thanks for letting me know\"  and that he could get us another table.  I didn\\'t want to move with 4 plates and water and everything. He missed the whole point of what I told him.\\n\\nAt the end we waited over 30 mins to get out waiters attention and when heaven opened up and down he came miraculously we asked for the check and waited and waited and waited over 30 mins for the check. We were met with blatant with apathy, discrimination and disrespect to the point where they couldn\\'t even bring us the check. \\n\\nThose people are very DISGUSTING. They have no manners or class.

Everything was so flavorful and delicious, and the rest of the food looks so good I know I'll be going back soon to try more.  They have hot sauces on the counter if you're crazy like me and can only eat food that's spicy.  The jonny cake, which is one of the bread options, would make Dr. Atkins roll over in his grave.

Also note they're closed on Saturdays.  The decor is modest and cheerful and there was just enough seating when I was there.  On the wall is evidence of Guy Fieri from Food Network visiting here, which is what made me aware of this place to begin with.  \\n\\nFor my lunch entree, all of which come with two sides, I paid a little over $9 (chicken and veggies are a little less than fish).

The staff were really friendly.\\n\\nWe each tried the original style donut {non dipped, with cinnamon sugar}, filled with chocolate custard. We had just had a vanilla custard pie a day ago so I didn't want it again, but definitely wish we had it instead. The donut batter was nice and fluffy, and the cinnamon sugar coating gritty and sweet - so satisfying! However the chocolate custard just tasted like chocolate pudding which kind of grossed me out.\\n\\nI would like to try the same donut but with vanilla custard next time. We were in a rush so I didn't ask what gourmet premade donuts were available for the extra 50 cents but saw sour candies on top of a few so would love to know more about them next time!\\n\\nOur two donuts came to just under $6. I find this price quite appropriate since they are a million times better than the $1 donuts you get at Tim Hortons, for comparison sake.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back!\"]\n"

We recently brought in a litter of 6 puppies and waited 45 minutes in a room for them to all get their 1 vaccine. This past week we took in our older dogs to get neutered and spayed,and when my husband went to pick them up (after we'd been told they were ready for pick up) he had to wait 30 minutes, mostly because for 15 minutes he was never greeted or helped. He had to approach the front desk again after 3 techs had walked by him without acknowledging him. 15 more minutes to bring the dogs out. Today my husband brought one puppy in for a second vaccine. Waited 15 minutes to be taken back, 10 minutes to be seen, and while seen  the Dr. mentioned the puppy might have signs of an ear infection so she would like to take a quick look... Well without being warned that was a lovely $18 extra added charge. To check out his ear mucus was a hidden cost we were never told of until we were hit with a $40 bill for 1 shot (much more than we've previously plaid). Only after we left and say receipt did we realize we'd been secretly hit with the fee. Also this doctor suggest ear drops for $30... We just got some for our other dog 2 days ago- for $20...

      " 'As I lay here thinking about my 4 month stint with my job here near New Orleans and the places that I have gotten the pleasure of eating at, it strikes me that this is only one of two places that I would deem a 5 star in my book.\\n\\nI passed this place maybe a dozen times and judged the book by it\\'s cover, naughty naughty but you know what? I finally got tired of eating mall food court places and the casino buffet down the road as well.  I stopped in the parking lot and skimmed over some reviews.  \"Charge by the pound\", nope, not going to do that, especially when the plates are seemingly already 2 lbs each.  These aren\\'t your dollar store plates, they are sturdy, thick, non scuffed from timely use and can show you the stars when planted on your head as a haymaker, ouch!\\n\\nOutside parking seems ample for the business here.  It was a 1pm Saturday visit and only the front row was taken up but 10 feet back the second row was empty.  \\n\\nEntrance, your first impression is it\\'s clean, could use a little better looking interior design but that would probably raise the price up.  What you get here is a no nonsense meat fest, reasonable pricing, very attentive and friendly staff.  \\n\\nI was greeted by the nice looking waitress asking me if I have ever been here before.  After holding my head down a little in shame she explained a little on what to do, asked what I wanted to drink and where to sit.  I headed towards the buffet part which was full of items I could not for my life remember the names except for the plaintains (Fried bananas), white rice and other sides that I was allowed to photograph.  \\n\\nOn to the parilla.  The guy behind the counter asked if I have been there before and what kind of meat did I want.  I told him that I wasn\\'t sure at the moment and squinted a little to see what was on the grills, without hesitation he fixed me up with an assortment of meat on a 7\" plate.  \\n\\nPretty much everything I tried had good flavor, was not dry as I was thinking and for the price on the weekend of $17.23 (tax included butt not drink) is very reasonable compared to the $25 that I am used too in Houston.  \\n\\nYou don\\'t get the goucho boys coming to your table with racks of the meat but instead you go and get it which one shouldn\\'t mind at all unless they were on some intricate date.  \\n\\nService:  Courteous, genuine and non obtrusive.  Oh, and they aren\\'t there in the back texting on their phones, leaning up against the counter in a group or sitting at a table in your view eating while scoping out your every move.  Sorry, pet peeve of mine but did not find anything like that here.  \\n\\nThey do have a selection of beers here as well as three televisions for your viewing pleasures.  \\n\\nThe all you can eat is a different price on the weekdays so I probably will provide that information today when I get back.\\n\\nThey do have a dessert selection but I was so bloated to wheres\\'t it looked like I was expecting a baby at about 2 months. O o. \\n\\nAttached or in the same suite is a meat market where I assume they get their meat for the grill as well.  A pretty good selection if you want to go home and do this yourself.  Parilla not included. \\n\\nUnfortunately within a couple of weeks I will get transferred back to Texas with the memory that this place strongly reminded me of the comfort type food I would always find at home.  Laying here typing this review and thinking about that food again makes me promise myself that I am going to get up in a few hours and go back to this hidden gem that took me a while to find.  \\n\\nThank you staff, cooks and the owners for being so courteous to an out of town stranger and making me feel like I was back in Houston again.

The fiance was also excited for the steamed dumplings, which he thought might be similar to the soup dumplings he misses so much from NYC.  They were indeed similar, though smaller and less soup-filled than the ones he loves.  Again, though, he'd order them upon returning to Chinatown.\\n\\nThough we both enjoyed our food, we were a little put off by the service we received.  We found our waitress to be flippant and unfriendly, and we never received the soup noodles, oranges, or fortune cookies we saw other tables receiving when ordering similar items.  Considering we ordered from both the lunch and dinner menus and paid a nice (though reasonable) price for our lunch, we were disappointed that we didn't receive the same treatment as the other customers in the restaurant.\\n\\nRegardless, for Chinese food that actually tastes like Chinese food, we'll be coming back soon for more.\"\n",

See, I am not a beer drinker...so to go to a brewery is just not the norm for me. But everyone I talked to said that the food was great so I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nWe went in on a Saturday late in the afternoon around 4pm. I first could not believe how big they made this place. I also couldn't get over the fact that I was eating in what used to be Nordstrom. We were quickly seated and told that our server would be right over. We began to look through the drink and regular menu and began to discuss what we were going to ordered. Everything pretty much sounded good so it was tough to narrow it down.\\n\\nWhile we looked a guy came up and told us that he would get us our drinks while we waited for our server. I thought that was nice and ordered a diet coke and strawberry fields martini (it sounded good). While he was away our actual server came over and introduced himself. We started off with an appetizer just because we still didn't know what we wanted to eat yet. While we waited for that we narrowed down what we wanted and ordered the rest. This is the last time we see our server until much, much later.\\n\\nEvery time that something was brought to our table it was done by a different person. When our main course came out no one cleared the plates off the table from the appetizer. Our server seriously never came back. My diet coke was refilled by one of the managers. It was so annoying...to the point where I do not know who actually got the tip.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes: we started with the onion rings. They were amazing. They had a great batter on them that was full of flavor. It also came with a regular ranch and a southwest ranch to dip them in. For the main meal I went with a burger. It had a great grilled flavor to it and was cooked the way that I wanted it to be cooked. The fries had good flavor for being fries. All around the food was great!! My martini was not what I was expecting though. I have had flavored ones before that taste good but this was like drinking straight vodka. OMG it was a struggle to finish it...but I did as it was $11. If their drinks are based on that then they are worth the money because wow it was strong.\\n\\nWhen our server finally decided to return to the table and we told him that we did not want any dessert I would assume that a normal server would drop off the check. Nope, not this guy. We had to sit there and wait quite awhile for him to come back around to ask him for it. With how much this guy was not around I could have walked out without paying and they would probably not have known for quite some time. But I am not like that...so I obviously did not walk out without paying.\\n\\nI really wish that the service would have matched the price that we paid for the meal. If that had happened I would have given probably 5 stars...but they barely get 3 because they left me feeling abandoned and not important enough to receive great service.\"\n",

Walking up to it (or walking through the neighborhood even) made me a little apprehensive about what this place might provide in the way of \"cool\" or \"hipster\" bowling. I was pleasantly surprised. First, the staff is super friendly and helpful in shoe sizes and getting us started on our games. Second, the design of the place is so cool; from its retro furnishings and lighting fixtures of the \\'50s era to the swanky bar. It is super spacious and well kept. \\n\\nAs Andrew and I got started on our games the waitress came up to take our drink order. We ordered a pitcher of the \"Walt Wit\" which is similar to a Blue Moon. We did not order food but the family bowling next to us did. I was amazed to see what appears to be a surprisingly sophisticated menu for a bowling alley. What is really unique about this spot is that it takes the retro lounge style of a bowling alley and matches it with a more affordable time for food and drink (as well as with better quality). I am always attracted to a place that combines my favorites: good food & drink, friends/family and doing something active. \\n\\nAnd no, unfortunately I did not win. Andrew, who bowls every Wednesday in a league at school, played a good game!

The inside of the restaurant consisted of mostly being indoors with part of dining area being exposed outside. It was a very unique setup, with pretty sheet decor matching the French Quarter theme. Wait staff was very friendly. Seating is pretty tight. I mean right to which point I could stick my arm out and grab what is in my neighbors plate. Nonetheless on to the food, I ordered the fresh fish Florentine. This dish consisted of blackened catfish with hollandaise sauce. Honestly the catfish tasted over cooked with an overwhelming taste of charred fish. There was also one moment where I had a mouth full of something soggy which I couldn't identify but could only attest that it was just uncooked parts of the catfish. The sauce was just blah, nothing to write home about. I wanted to try the southern pecan pie only because it was fitting where I was being in New Orleans. This however did not disappointed; probably the best pecan pie topped with ice cream that I've ever experienced. Maybe the cooking was off because of the large crowd however I was a bit disappointed on the quality of food I had this day. I can see why it's a local favorite but maybe this dish just wasn't one of its specialties.\"\n",

I am not a desert person and so I love a little cheese platter after a good meal. The first night I mentioned the the bartender this insight and she made me an after dinner cheese platter. The next night I went, the bartender didnt seem interested in asking the kitchen if they could make it. It was only after I told her I had already had one that she agreed.\\n\\nThe great thing is the the second cheese platter was better the second night (came with a strawberry brittle-type invention and a little bread for the creamy cheese). \\n\\nAll the food was great.

Upon receiving, I took a bite into my burger and it was a but soft,  I took a second bite and it was completely mushy, and appeared to undercooked. As someone who does not eat beef and has eaten her fair share of turkey burgers, along with cooking my own, I'm very aware of the difference between cooked, uncooked/undercooked ground turkey. In no way should it be mushy. Once I discovered this, I was very concerned about getting sick.  I really find it unacceptable for any restaurant to serve uncooked or undercooked poultry. I also requested for well done bacon and was given barely cooked bacon as well.  As for the Wagyu burger, it was ok, however my boyfriend thought it lacked flavor. I gave two stars because when I contacted the restaurant, the bartender that answered the phone sound concerned and cared enough to take down my info and give it to the manager.

If it's your first, you won't be disappointed - the staff will make you feel at ease, and ensure you are happy.

      " \"Don't sign anything with hoosier contractors. All the negative reviews are true, they have very poor communication and are incredibly hard if not impossible to get a hold of. I signed a contract with them to do the roof on my house and went thru the process with the insurance company and when it came time to pick out the shingle color they made the appointment time with me twice and both times they cancelled. After numerous attempts to call them ( no one ever answers the phone at their office) I started getting estimates from other contractors. When I informed them that I may not use them, they did not even try to work thru this issue with me. Instead of being a true respectful inderstanding business they opted to call their lawyer and send me a notice of intent to collect if I did not let them do the job. Just so you understand I did sign the contract with them but I had no idea they would be so impossible to work with. That being said I will pay the cost to cancel the contract with them because I do not trust them AT ALL and the way they handle their customers is very unprofessional. BEWARE if you sign a contract with them it could cost you up to 2000.00 to get out of your contract. At this point it is worth it to me me as my opinion of their business practices are very poor.They are not willing to reach out when there is a problem caused by them like most men would instead the owner sickes his lawyer on you. Also their contract you sign with them is very one-sided in their favor and allows them to stall the job for virtually any reason with no recourse from you. DONT SIGN THE CONTRACT!\"]\n"

When the food was finally delivered, Megan didn't know who's wings were which, and one of our entrees didn't come out until 15 minutes after everyone else's. Although everything went wrong so far, the food was hot and delicious. Good job back of house. At the end of our meal we got our checks and all of ours were wrong. I was charged $5 over what we actually had and our server would not change it. We were so frustrated at that point that we just paid the bill and left. Our server even went to the lengths to roll her eyes at us and not speak to us. We understand a busy night is difficult, but the service we received was unacceptable.\"\n",

      " 'Oh YES!\\n\\nSince I\\'m quite lazy and it was hot today, after I finished up with my massage and pedicure, my mind was making numerous excuses not to walk the 6 blocks to have a late-ish lunch at Winkel. I told it to shut up and set out over to Locust St. and off towards the Gayborhood. Glad I did for so many reasons, one being that until I am actually on that street, it always slips my memory how charming Locust is and how much I enjoy strolling it. \\n\\nWinkel looks pleasant as one approaches. Blue awnings with the restaurant name in white, yellow tulips, big windows, outdoor seating. It\\'s welcoming.\\n\\nThe place was buzzing when I arrived. I was greeted and seated by Bob, Joncarl Lachman\\'s husband, who was on the floor serving. He\\'s very sweet. The menu is all day breakfast and lunch which is a delight. If you feel like eggs at 2 p.m., they have you covered. Same with a salad for breakfast. They gotcha. None of that, \"oh, we stopped serving waffles/eggs/pancakes at 10 a.m.\" High five to breakfast until 3.\\n\\nThe deep fried French toast sounded decadently good but as I said, it was hot, I\\'d already had a big breakfast hours earlier and I really do love a salad. While I sometimes make them at home, my own cooking bores me no matter what I prepare. A huge salad for one, with all the ingredients and textures I like in it, needs to be prepared and eaten all in the same day so to me, it\\'s usually more of a bother than a treat. In light of that, I chose the beet and gouda salad and iced tea. Service was quick (Bob again) and Joncarl was also on the floor, pouring iced tea and coffee, introducing himself and chatting with diners. Both men are extremely hospitable and it did not feel \"new restaurant put on a happy face\" false. \\n\\nMy iced tea was bottomless and very good-no sugar or lemon, just clear, brisk tea over ice, the way I make it myself. Not over steeped nor did it taste like old, over brewed Lipton with a few ice cubes thrown in. \\n\\nThe salad was also how I like to compose mine-a heaping pile of mixed greens (only minor complaint-lose that frisee-though it\\'s just a personal gripe), nicely but not soggily dressed with a sweet and sour dressing and on top of as well as hidden in the green depths were bite size chunks of roasted red beets, mandarin orange sections, long and plentiful shreds of gouda cheese and lots and lots of walnut halves with not a bitter one among them. What I really loved was when I was getting down to the last of the lettuces, there was still plenty of the \"good stuff\" on my plate. So, you don\\'t just get a lot of rabbit food with a little bit of the expensive stuff topping it just for show. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t just a delicious, refreshing salad that made me enjoy my visit. This place exudes good cheer and welcome. There\\'s well modulated, mixed aka eclectic background music playing, decoration is minimal but well done-more blue and white, including Dutch looking tiles below the open kitchen area-and my 2 favorites-a blown up photo of an old Citroen and the phrase \"eet smakelijk\" (enjoy your meal) in bold caps on one wall. It\\'s all very much a  mix of the right elements-well prepared, simple food that is tweaked and elevated up several notches, attentive, cheerful service, a bright, spacious room that isn\\'t too loud for contemplation and conversation, even when at capacity and a great place for people watching. I read, I mused, I ate, I sipped my iced tea (and hooray-they use paper straws here!), I looked out the window. I was content. No rushing to turn over the table. No push to order more food. Everything was relaxed and came together blissfully to make the absolute perfect stop on my day off. If those elements are not in the mix, no matter how good or exotic the food, no matter how fabulous the rugs, the trendiness of the art on the walls, the quality of the marble bar or how famous the chef is, the whole thing falls flat. \\n\\nOne server asked if I\\'d like the Dutch apple cake for dessert. I hesitated because my late mother made this every week for years and it was dreadful. So bad I have not eaten it since high school. I hesitated, then said yes. Good choice. This was almost pure apple, thinly sliced and layered, most of the sweetness coming directly from the fruit, not from a gravy boat full of sugar. Just barely held together with some buttery batter. It was spiced lightly and topped with a hearty dollop of unsweetened whipped cream. The first forkful made me sigh with pleasure. I told the server when she checked back with me that this version had completely cured me of decades of bad Dutch apple cake PTSD. We both laughed. She was planning on having the last piece. \\n\\nVan Morrison did a song on the album Avalon Sunset back in 1989 called Coney Island. As I left Winkel with a lighter step and headed out into the late afternoon, I was reminded of the last verse in that song \"...Wouldn\\'t it be great if it was like this all the time...\" \\n\\nDon\\'t miss Winkel!
