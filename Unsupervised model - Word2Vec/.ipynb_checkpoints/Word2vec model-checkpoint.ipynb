Given its location in the Gulch and a lot of talk about how amazing this place was.. I really expected it to be on par in price if not higher then Whole foods. I am so excited to say I was wrong. They had so many items on sale that were significantly lower then even Publix. I love how they even have a juice bar/hot lunch bar. You can purchase beer singles for $1.99 and have it in store! The store was a lot larger then I thought when  I noticed that the meats were sectioned off. I love how they sell individual portion sizes of fish. For example, a Tilapia filet was ~$2. It really makes it easy to stop by on a weekday night to pick up some quick items to make dinner or just get something from the prepared foods section. I would not come to the Turnip truck to buy vegetables and fruits as they were pricier. However, worth noting is that they sell farm fresh eggs for $4 which is the equivalent price point as the farmers market. I am still amazed at the sales they were running in the store. I got 2 bags of hummus chips for .99cents each! \\n\\nAlso, I wanted to say that their customer service is amazing. I really enjoyed meeting the manager and the cashiers were very helpful!'\n",

      " 'The atmosphere in Major Restaurant was definitely beautiful, calming and different. I felt transported to a new place by the photos and artwork! I came with a friend and our waiter was so friendly we felt really welcome and at home. We ordered the combination platter because it offered 4 meat combinations (lamb for us) and seven vegetable sides. We were also given extra bread and three side items, spicy and medium sauce as well as handmade crumble cheese. As you may know it is traditional to wash your hands and eat the food with your hands using the bread to scoop up what you wanted. We requested spoons to make the scooping easier but mainly used our hands to eat the food. The food also sits on the gray spongy bread that accompanies the main dish and so when you \"eat it all\" you literally clear the entire plate! And that\\'s what we did! Nothing was left! After enjoying our food my friend and I vowed to return to try the other combinations! I look forward to the shrimp combination and hope my out of town family members can join me there! It\\'s a very enchanting place, relaxing, and great to have a long chat. Even though they closed at 9pm (we accidentally stayed until 9:15) they did not rush us out or make us feel unwelcome in any way and we were so grateful and happy! Very excited to return!'\n",

      " \"Great value, consistent with quality and taste, and hands-down, best Pho broth in the city!\\n\\nMost pho places, to my understanding, use flavour enhancing powders (that you can purchase from most Asian supermarkets) in the broth.  Tau Bay, according to one of the owner's friends, creates the savoury, rich taste from scratch with raw materials: beef bones and briskets.\\n\\nHaving been to more than 30 different Pho places between Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto, Tau Bay definitely has the best Vietnamese noodle soup.  If you like your soup a bit spicy, their home-made chill oil is also to die for.  It adds to the flavour of the broth very well.\\n\\nYou might be wondering why I've only rated 4 stars if i LOVE it so much.  This is a good time for me to clarify my position on all my reviews.  Aside from the food, I tend to rate my overall dining experience in every place I visit, and the only drawback for me with Tau Bay is the payment option.  I like, and have always preferred, to pay with cards rather than cash.  There have been times when lack of cash deterred me from enjoying a nice bowl of Tau Bay pho.\"\n",
      " 'Convenient location. Ate dinner there last nite. It was our anniversary and we told them so. We ordered the stuffed grouper and the filet. After waiting too long for food arrival, the host checked on the order and out it came. My filet was great, but my husbands grouper had a very dry stuffing. We told the waitress and she offered a sauce. Not a good thing . Disappointing anniversary meal.'\n",
      " 'Let me just start this review by saying I am a bit biased as my love for tacos takes hold over everything. Now that that has been said it would be safe to say that this place is legit. I am not a fan of the loop as its raging with hipster and college students later at night, but this hidden gem of a delight is tucked back in the heart of Delmar in the place of what used to be the old Delmar Lounge. \\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. The food is great and reasonably priced for the fact their kitchen is open late even on weekdays. For people like me that consistently get off at 9pm, that means my friends and I have a place to go to get a drink and let off some steam. \\n\\n2. The drinks are reasonably prices as well. I didn\\'t feel bad paying for a beer.\\n\\n3. They have duck tacos. That\\'s right.. Duck. \\n\\nCons: \\n\\n1. As its a newer joint, the waitressing staff isn\\'t that great. I\\'ve been there 3 times over the past 2 weeks with different friends and the bartender has been consistently backed up to the point we had to wait 5-10 minutes for our beverages from the bar. The common catch phrase when the waitress would finally bring our drinks would usually be \"I\\'d like to preorder my next drink.\"\\n\\n2. Being an establishment that sells tacos and a variety of them, you would think they would have a system down for keeping good track of whom orders what in larger parties. Instead, when I was there with a group of 6 and was getting ready to leave, they charged me for 2 tacos I didn\\'t eat because they had forgotten to charge another person that had already left. I was really not pleased. \\n\\nThat\\'s all I really have. It\\'s a great place if you get the right waitress or waiter. Speed of service with the food is amazing. Our food was at the table within of finally ordering. I recommend giving it a shot.']\n"

We went to see a friend play at this place and the group before him was very lively and and energetic and the soloist after our friend was also nice.\\nThe second time i went, was on a saturday night and let me tell you IT WAS INCREDIBLE! 2 Hip hop DJ's were spinning great hits from back in the day and mixed it with some of the better top 40 music! I really enjoyed the crowed and the crowed seemed to enjoy the music. \\n\\nI have to admit I was a little disappointed with the late night taco menu... but in their defense it is bar food. their fish tacos were kinda blah and the sauces could be more authentic (home-made) it is Tucson after all.\\n\\nTHE BATHROOM:\\nas far as I know their is only 1 bathroom in this establishment so there always seem to be a line. \\nThis place tends to attract charismatic people so you can be sure to have a good conversation while you wait.\"\n",

      " 'Disheartened by the lack of service. The restaurant was not full at all, yet the hostess (older lady), attempted to sit us away form everyone else over by the window. I politely asked for a booth (just like everyone else). Once seated, and after 6 minutes, I had to stop a waiter and ask him who was servicing our table. Surprise, it happened to be him. Next, I asked if the pickel bar was for everyone. Surprise again, it was. (Why wouldnt he have told me that once he took our order??) After going to the pickle bar, I sat looking at my bowl for about 3 minutes.. Why? Because we we never given any place settings (mat, utensils, napkin). I had to yet AGAIN ask for it. Now the food arrives and less than 2 minutes later, the server placed our check in the middle of the table. Now, prior to our food arriving, I\\'d told him that I was going to also order something to-go. So, why would you give me my check?? I had to stop him a few times because he forgot to bring an item or a food item wasn\\'t delivered, etc..... This experience was not welcoming at all, in fact, I felt as if my son and I were not wanted. Now I am not one the play the race card, but when we are the only people of color in the restaurant at that time and we receive lesser-than service, I couldn\\'t help but think this. My 15yr old even noticed it. I didn\\'t have to say a word. Especially when he says \"Wow Mom, that table (of 5) got their food fast\". I could only respond \"I know\". I cannot take anything away from the delicious food, however, the staff needs some work.'\n",

I must say it was the worst experience at an Italian restaurant that I have ever experienced. \\nOur waitress Mary was non attentive and acted like we were bugging her each time we asked for something, drinks didn\\'t get refilled until we asked for a refill even though she came by while they were empty to drop off food. She rarely came by the table and acted like the food was the best thing yet!..... I have news for you.\\nThe food was not good at all the pizza was bland and could have used another couple of minutes in the oven, the spinach dip came out looking like she just sprinkled mozzarella cheese on the top without melting it, and again it had no flavor. The bread it came with was overcooked with minimal flavor. DO NOT GET A CANNOLI from here it was soggy and once again lacked flavor and had soggy pistachios on both ends. The best thing there was my coke! It was perfect aside from it never got refilled unless I caught her for a split second and asked.\\nLastly they added 18% gratuity... we had four adults and two babies... one baby didn\\'t eat and the other bibles on some pizza.... no where on the menu does it say gratuity would be added for X amount of people in a party nor did they tell us before seating us... and since when were kids counted as people in a gratuity charge?! I wanted to speak to the manager but of course my husband calmed me down and told me it\\'s fine -_- I just wanted to ask why they would add gratuity on without even notifying us and even more so when we only had four adults that the waitress delt with and served while the kids sat there like potatoes this isn\\'t because I wasn\\'t going to tip her, I\\'m a great tipper having worked in this industry for years not only front of house but also in the accounting area where I know how much the servers make after tip and before so I know what a big chunk tips play in their daily take home and even with her 18% gratuity she threw on our checks I\\'m not sure she even deserved that. \\nOverall DONT GO HERE. A big waste!\\n\\nOh and did I mention she didn\\'t properly swipe my husbands card so when she came back with our checks she said, \"so who had the spinach dip? Your card only ran 24.00 you owe us 6.something\" I looked at her like wtf? Of course my husband was upset and said I\\'m sorry? You need to run that again. Of course she did and came back saying, \"it went through darn computers\".\\nFirst of all who even comes back saying something like that after a card doesn\\'t go through? Not to mention so everyone can hear that? Especially when she was the one who made the mistake! Needless to say it was embarrassing and didn\\'t need to happen if she did her job right.']\n",

They're prepared with ume, which we were told is a fermented plum paste. Maybe we don't like ume, but the person I was dining with found the flavor pretty revolting so I finished them for us, and I was not impressed with the way they tasted. Definitely over complicating a dish that should remain simple.\\n\\nThe chicken breast was fair, but the portion size was MINUSCULE. It basically was $26 for a slice of chicken breast. Not value.\\n\\nThe wagyu, though. Wow. Yes, it was expensive. And yes, it was so worth it. This steak and the sauce it was paired with was one of the most delicious bites I've tasted in a long time, and I'm finding myself salivating recalling it right now. The cook was perfect, the texture was moist and juicy and tender, and the flavor was incredibly intense and savory. One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. \\n\\nDessert was a let down, also. Other than the flambee, this dish was basically a pile of chocolate sauce with no real depth of flavor. Some dry crumbly cookies accompanied the pile of molten/scorched chocolate on the plate. Definitely not my favorite. Fun presentation though.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\n\\nVery contemporary feel with flowing shapes throughout the entire restaurant. I appreciated the consistency of this fluid theme. \\n\\nService:\\n\\nFairly sub par. We waited a while for our food and didn't receive water for a long time (~30 min.) too. \\n\\nWe weren't impressed with the experience at Morimoto. This is my third time in attendance, and for the price I have to say it's definitely not worth it. If I had an amazing experience with attentive service and a more consistent quality of food across the meal, they'd receive a much greater review from me.
